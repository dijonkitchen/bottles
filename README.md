## Installation

Download from https://github.com/dijonkitchen/bottles

If you want to do the exercise yourself, you can check out the starting branch with the initial test suite: https://github.com/dijonkitchen/bottles/tree/01-starting-test-suite
## Usage

Full song:
```sh
lein run
```

### Options

A single verse:
```sh
lein run [verse-number]
```

Multiple verses:
```sh
lein run [starting-verse ending-verse]
```

### Examples

;; 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
;; Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
```

```sh
lein run 2 1
;; 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
;; Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
;; 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
;; Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
```

## Testing

```sh
lein test
```


## Beliefs/Desires

Hoping to learn something by exercising functional programming in Clojure to figure out a tough problem in object-orieneted programming.

Wondering if it'll be any easier/simpler.
